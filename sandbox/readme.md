Sandbox Read Me
===

## Flightpath Concept

* Open a file of FlightGear data that saved and display that data in 3D.

## Notes

The [home page]( http://fgx.github.io/sandbox/ ) menu on the left provides links to all directories in this sandbox directory that have 'read me' files.

The important script is the 'flightpath' script. This script may take a while to load. If the terrain appears white, you should reload the page.
