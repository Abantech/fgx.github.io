	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device 
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the check box to display mesh as solid or wireframe
* Click the 'I' in the circle to go to the read me file

## Change Log

### 2016-07-21 ~ R8

* FlightPath now in flight-path-r1a.js



### 2016-07-20 ~ R7

* Flight path and terrain now appear to be aligned and scaled correctly
* Based on Elevations View 3D Core R1
* Objectify flightpath characteristics


### 2016-07-13 ~ R4

What I am learning

* Need to identify center of the elevations in the file name
* Need to be able to produce elevation files that are not just squares
* Need ways of adjusting the zoom level of the map overlays
* Need to work out vertical scaling

Done

* Flight paths are drawn in their correct positions 
* Landscapes are not

### 2016-07-12 ~ R3

Nearly there. Still includes some of my idiosyncrasies.

Could be working more properly in next release 

* Move all objects to their lat/lon and sizes in decimal.degrees ( ie 0.00001 range )
    * Replaces bringing everything to near the origin with sizes  in the 1 to 100 range ( ie typical CAD/CAM thinking )  
* Detail the menu
* Code cleanup
* Displays three flightpaths



### 2016-07-11 ~ R2

* Clean up

### 2016-07-10 ~ R1

* First commit
* Add Read Me
