Due to the hilly terrain, deciding a runway 17, left, 1500 circuit is difficult, and the one shown here is still to be approved by a LEIG local flying instructors.

#### Basic Outline

Line up on runway 17, take off climbing to 1,500 ft (about 2600 AMSL). While still in the climb, turn left over the castle on the hill, [El Castell de Cabrera][1], about 41.5128,1.695, and fly up the valley, curving left, and over at about 41.58629661,1.71422151 to rejoin the A-2 coming down the adjacent valley, slowing to 80 kts, and decending, rejoining final 17...

Flying this circuit in fgfs, with c172p, using the io capabilities of FG wrote this raw csv file - `LEIG-L1500-raw-01.csv` - 11,338 lines at 1Hz, nearly 80 csv fields. 

The definition of these fields comes from `playback.xml`. That gives the full list of `chunks`. For this exercise, the relevant fields being around offset 48, like -

````
49: latitude-deg            /position/latitude-deg
50: longitude-deg           /position/longitude-deg
51: altitude-ft             /position/altitude-ft
52: roll-deg                /orientation/roll-deg
53: pitch-deg               /orientation/pitch-deg
54: heading-deg             /orientation/heading-deg
55: side-slip-rad           /orientation/side-slip-deg
56: airspeed-kt             /velocities/airspeed-kt
````

Using a perl script, extracted this set, and wrote a - `LEIG-L1500-cooked-01.csv` - changing the order a little to `lon,lat,alt,hdg,ias,roll,pitch,slip`... **Note**: The altitude-ft is AMSL...

Also the output begins even before the scenery is loaded, so commences with a few hundred records with a **no altitude** of -9999, and these records have been excluded...

Also noted that it had an overlapping section on the runway. This **overlap** section should also be removed... no back tracking to the start... always continuous forward movement... Added a parameter to the script to also skip records **below** a `minimum` IAS, and setting this to 53 kts gets no `overlap`, but now a small gap... 

However, this gap is only 16 m, 52 feet, hdg 249, 0.58 sec, at 27.3 mps, 89.5 fps - ie 53 Kts. Since the sampling is at 1Kh, that should only be a quick `slip` from **end** to **start** ...

Do not have anyway to avoid this at present, but you can now see it is a plane starting at 53 Kts, taking off, landing, slowing to 53 Kts, then off on the next curcuit... hopefully **smoothly**...

This `cooked` csv could be the basis for a model, flying the circuit, over the hilly terrain... should look quite spectacular... with 3D DEM terrain...

The next challenge is to add POI. Well, in this case they would be visual turning points, other visual clues to follow this circuit... I will try to attach my LEIG-L1500-01.png 2D representational image, with I think `placards`?

In my case these are generated by adding LEIG.xg castle.xg lake.xg a-2.xg a-2-ne.xg built up using various sources... unfortunately most do not include an altitude... not sure how to convert these to csv, xml, or whatever you can use...

When finished, this could be be linked to a [VFR LEBL-LEIG Tutorial](https://drive.google.com/a/geoffair.info/file/d/0B2wA-loaS2xnenBpQlVRTE9FbkU/view), WIP, as a quick visual review of the landing at LEIG...
