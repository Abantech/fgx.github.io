## [jsZip Test R1]( http://fgx.github.io/sandbox/jszip-test/index.html )

## Features

* Opens, reads and displays text files
* Saves opened to to a zip file
* Opens zip file using file dialog, unzips and displays text
* Opens zip file from an URL and displays results
* Opens text file from an URL and displays results

## Observations

Loading text file directly looks like being faster than downloading and unzipping - even on first run.
Once data is in cache, text dominates overwhelmingly.
