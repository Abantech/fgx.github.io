![FGx Logo]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-cap-40x30.png) FGx GitHub Repository Guidelines
================================

## Concept
This file provides suggestions to help you collaborate effectively with the other members of the FGx team.

## Repository Naming

Repositories have two names.

Title: What you would use in correspondence

* Example: FGx Flight Launcher
* Case: FGx is always 'FGx' - two uppers followed by a lower


File Name: how the repo appears in a URL

* Example: http://fgx.github.io/fgx-flight-launcher
* Case: always lower case always
* Punctuation: words separated by hyphens. No under_scores, no&20empty&20spaces

Repository names should be aimed toward FlightGear users.

* Good: FGx Airports Runways Navaids << most humans will understand
* Not so good: FGX ICAO JSON << only programmers and engineers will understand

* Good: FGx OSM CrossFeed Viewer
* Not so good: FGx Map Hacking 


## Forks from other Projects

Forks from other projects should not have FGx in the title, but should have the name of the original project

Generally, such forks should be in your personal GitHub project as opposed to the FGx project.


## Repository Creation and Modification

As Geoff said on 2013-12-05:

	As usual I am always struck by the fact
	that if you ask five different people, you
	are almost sure to get five different
	opinions ;=))))))))
	
A faster way of working:

* Go ahead and do it. 
* Wait and see if anubody slaps your wrist
* If not, repeat	

So here are some possible '[Rules of Engagement]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_engagement )' for FGx collaboration:

As long as the repo is completely your own work or a fork of anybody else's work, feel free to add, play and experiment

If the repo is collaborative - people besides yourself have committed to the repo - then you should ask them before renaming, moving or deleteing

Forks of other projects that are no longer useful should be deleted.
